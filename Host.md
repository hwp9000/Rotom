# Host Command
>The host command may seem simple at first, but for advanced raiders you can unlock more information then ever!

## Standard Hosting
>A standard user would be a normal player that hosts on a normal basis, but doesn't know too much about weather boosts and if locals will be present.

`-host @pokemon <# of trainers to invite> <time left>`

**Example:**`-host @Absol 5 15`

## Advanced Hosting:
> Advanced Hosting allows additional information to be displayed within the host message, along with the ability to rehost you previous raid using an alternate account.

### Hosting with Locals
> Adding an "L" to the end of your host command will allow you to state you have locals to assist with the raid, this informs other trainers in discord that there will be outside assistance.

**Example:** `-host @pokemon 5 15 L`

### Hosting with a Weather Boost
> Adding a W to the end of your host command will allow you to state the boss is weatherboosted, this informs other trainers in discord that the boss is weather boosted!

**Example:** `-host @pokemon 5 15 W`

### Hosting a Host only raid
> Adding a H to the end of your host command will allow you to state you are only hosting the lobby, this informs other trainers in discord that you will be leaving right before the fight starts!

**Example:** `-host @pokemon 5 15 W`

### Using Weather Boost, Locals and Hosted Only!
> You can add L, W and H to the end of your host command to state all three!

**Example:** `-host @pokemon 5 15 W L` *or* `-host @pokemon W L`
